# SO-EXAM


---------------------------------------------------NOTES------------------------------------------------------------

- This repository contains notes that I wrote during the exam preparation of operating systems, in the year 2023, 
may therefore differ and contain some optimization errors compared to the year to which you will refer. 
However they allowed me to successfully pass the exam and understand the fundamentals of operating systems, 
I recommend integrating to the notes, the textbook "Dhananjay M. Dhamdhere - Operating Systems".

- Leave a STAR if the contents of this repository were useful to you!
